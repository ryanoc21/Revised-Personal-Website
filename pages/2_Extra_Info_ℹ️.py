# Write about yourself.
st.write("""
At the height of the pandemic, I made a rather shocking discovery for a psychology undergraduate student - 
I was enjoying my statistics modules. This led me to tailor my degree to the pursuit of more 
quantitative and scientific fields of study. 
To supplement this, I taught myself python programming and more advanced maths. 
I used my dissertation to gain practical experience with these skills, and created a predictive model 
for the adoption intention of autonomous vehicles in Ireland.

st.write("""
I am now studying for a 30 ECTS credit postgraduate certificate in Data Science at Technological University Dublin.
I supplement my learning by providing programming and statistics tutoring to 
undergrad students from a wide array of academic disciplines. I also recently started freelance data analytics, 
which has allowed me to work on many exciting real world projects that are having an impact.
